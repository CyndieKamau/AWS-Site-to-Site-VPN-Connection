! Virtual Private Cloud

! AWS utilizes unique identifiers to manipulate the configuration of
! a VPN Connection. Each VPN Connection is assigned an identifier and is
! associated with two other identifiers, namely the
! Customer Gateway Identifier and Virtual Private Gateway Identifier.
!
! Your VPN Connection ID 		  : vpn-04c4928f53789cada
! Your Virtual Private Gateway ID  : vgw-09626d5260437f07b
! Your Customer Gateway ID		  : cgw-06e352ac9845b9871
!
!
! This configuration consists of two tunnels. Both tunnels must be
! configured on your Customer Gateway for redundancy.
!
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! IPSec Tunnel #1
! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! #1: Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Configuration
!
! A policy is established for the supported ISAKMP encryption, authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime,
! and key parameters.The IKE peer is configured with the supported IKE encryption,  authentication, Diffie-Hellman, lifetime, and key
! parameters.Please note, these sample configurations are for the minimum requirement of AES128, SHA1, and DH Group 2.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! You will need to modify these sample configuration files to take advantage of AES256, SHA256,  or other DH
! groups like 2, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! NOTE: If you customized tunnel options when creating or modifying your VPN connection, you may need to modify these sample configurations to match the custom settings for your tunnels.
!
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".
! The address of the external interface for your customer gateway must be a static address.
! Your customer gateway may reside behind a device performing network address translation (NAT). To
! ensure that NAT traversal (NAT-T) can function, you must adjust your firewall
! rules to unblock UDP port 4500.
! If not behind NAT, and you are not using an Accelerated VPN, we recommend disabling NAT-T. If you are using an Accelerated VPN, make sure that NAT-T is enabled.

! #2: IPSec Configuration
!
! The IPSec transform set defines the encryption, authentication, and IPSec
! mode parameters.
! Category "VPN" connections in the GovCloud region have a minimum requirement of AES128, SHA2, and DH Group 14.
! Please note, you may use these additionally supported IPSec parameters for encryption like AES256 and other DH groups like 2, 5, 14-18, 22, 23, and 24.
! Higher parameters are only available for VPNs of category "VPN," and not for "VPN-Classic".

Expand the VPN configuration clicking in "+" and then create a new Phase2 entry as follows:

 a. Disabled :uncheck
 b. Mode : Tunnel
 c. Local Network : Type: LAN subnet
    Address :  ! Enter your local network CIDR in the Address tab
 d. Remote Network : Type : Network
    Address :  ! Enter your remote network CIDR in the Address tab

 Phase 2 proposal (SA/Key Exchange)
 a. Protocol : ESP
 b. Encryption algorithms : aes128
  c. Hash algorithms : hmac-sha1-96
  d. PFS key group :   2
e. Lifetime : 3600 seconds

Advanced Options
